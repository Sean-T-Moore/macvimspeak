{"name":"MacVimSpeak","tagline":"An OSx app that lets you talk to your vim editor","body":"### MacVimSpeak\r\nMacVimSpeak is an OSx app that allows you to \"say\" Vim commands and the app will execute the corresponding key mappings for Vim. This is also a good way to learn about Vim, because those simple keystroke commands map to words! (ex. `a` for after, `A` for after [end of] a line).\r\n\r\nTo use the app:\r\n\r\n1. Download and install the app in your favorite way\r\n2. Run the app, it will be red with a \"Start Listening\" button\r\n3. Clicking on \"Start Listening\" puts the app into an active state, and now when you say commands, ex.\r\n   \"down 3\", the keycodes will be executed.\r\n   *IMPORTANT*: once you \"start listening\" change focus from MacVimSpeak to your chosen flavor of Vim! \r\n   (terminal, MacVim,     Sublime with Vim bindings, etc.)\r\n4. At any time, to stop keystrokes, say \"Shush\" and the app will sleep, and \"Wake up\" will wake it up again. \r\n   The \"Stop Listening\" button halts speech recognition, and you'll need to click it again to turn speech recognition on again.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is essentially a Mac port of Ashley Feniello (@AshleyF)'s VimSpeak project, and I think it's really cool.
